JavaScript is supported by most web browsers and has a versatile ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for various application development purposes."
what is React ?,"React is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly for web applications. It enables developers to create dynamic and interactive UI components by efficiently managing the updates and rendering of these components based on changes in data. React's component-based approach promotes reusable and maintainable code, making it a popular choice for modern web development."
Diffrence between let var and const,"let and var are both used to declare variables in JavaScript, but let has block scope, meaning it's limited to the block in which it's defined, while var has function scope, allowing it to be accessible throughout the entire function. On the other hand, const is also block-scoped but is used to declare constants that cannot be reassigned after their initial value assignment. This ensures immutability and prevents accidental changes to the value of the variable."
what is DOM,"The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects. Each object corresponds to a part of the document, such as an element or an attribute. Through the DOM, programs can access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of web documents."
Diffrence between state and props,"In the context of React (a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces), both state and props are key concepts that allow data to flow through a component. "
